# Home Component Refactoring Guide

## Overview

This refactoring reduces the cognitive complexity of the Home component from 27 to approximately 10-12 by extracting logic into custom hooks and separate components.

## What Changed

### Before
- **570 lines** in a single component
- **9 state variables**
- **16 callback functions**
- **Complex nested conditionals** in render
- **Mixed concerns** (data fetching, UI state, business logic)

### After
- **~150 lines** in the main component
- **4 state variables** (tasks, settings, isInitializing, settingsOpen)
- **Minimal callbacks** in the component
- **Clear separation of concerns**
- **Reusable hooks and components**

## New Files Created

### Custom Hooks

1. **`hooks/use-task-sync.ts`** (200 lines)
   - Manages all sync-related logic
   - Handles API client creation
   - Manages sync states with a single state machine
   - Includes error handling with user-friendly messages

2. **`hooks/use-task-filters.ts`** (70 lines)
   - Manages search and filter state
   - Computes filtered tasks with memoization
   - Handles duplicate removal
   - Calculates unread count

3. **`hooks/use-task-actions.ts`** (60 lines)
   - Encapsulates all task CRUD operations
   - Handles database updates
   - Manages toast notifications

4. **`hooks/use-error-dialog.ts`** (30 lines)
   - Simplifies error dialog state management
   - Provides clean API for showing/hiding errors

### Components

1. **`components/empty-state.tsx`** (50 lines)
   - Handles empty task list UI
   - Differentiates between no tasks and filtered results

2. **`components/task-grid.tsx`** (60 lines)
   - Renders the task list grid
   - Includes loading more indicator
   - Shows "no more data" message

3. **`components/no-backend-state.tsx`** (25 lines)
   - Shows when no backend is configured
   - Prompts user to open settings

## How to Apply the Refactoring

1. **Copy the refactored Home component** from `app/page-refactored.tsx` to `app/page.tsx`
2. **Ensure all new files are in place**:
   - All hooks in the `hooks/` directory
   - All components in the `components/` directory
3. **Run the formatter** to ensure code style consistency:
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```
4. **Test the application** thoroughly to ensure functionality is preserved

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Maintainability**
- Each hook has a single responsibility
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Components are more focused

### 2. **Better Testability**
- Hooks can be tested in isolation
- Components have fewer dependencies
- Business logic is separated from UI

### 3. **Enhanced Reusability**
- Hooks can be used in other components
- Error handling is centralized
- Task operations are standardized

### 4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**
- Main component is much easier to understand
- Logic is organized by domain
- State management is simplified

## Key Improvements

### 1. **State Consolidation**
- Sync states (`isLoading`, `isLoadingMore`, `isRefreshing`) → single `syncState`
- Error dialog object → hook with clean API

### 2. **Logic Extraction**
- Complex `getSyncErrorMessage` → utility function
- API client creation → inside sync hook
- Task filtering → dedicated hook with memoization

### 3. **Component Decomposition**
- Empty states → separate components
- Task grid → dedicated component
- Loading states → simplified

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- Centralized error message formatting
- Consistent error display
- Better user feedback

## Migration Notes

- All functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to the API
- Database operations remain the same
- UI behavior is identical

## Future Improvements

1. **Add unit tests** for each hook
2. **Create a `useAppInitialization` hook** to further simplify the main component
3. **Consider using a state management library** (Zustand/Jotai) for global state
4. **Add error boundaries** for better error handling
5. **Implement virtual scrolling** for better performance with large task lists
